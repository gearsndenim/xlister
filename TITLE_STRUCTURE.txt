When selling clothes on eBay, title structure is critical for visibility in search results and buyer click-through. eBay search heavily relies on title keywords—not descriptions or item specifics—so structuring them properly makes a direct impact on sell-through rate (STR).

Here’s what’s known to work well:

🔹 General Structure (Clothing Titles)
Brand + Item Type + Gender + Size + Color + Features + Style Keywords

Example:

🔹 Best Practices
Maximize all 80 characters – Use the full space for keywords buyers search.

Start with brand – Buyers often search by brand first.

Use full words for sizes – e.g., “Large” not “L” if space allows (some exceptions exist).

Use high-traffic keywords – like “Slim Fit,” “Y2K,” “Western,” “Grunge,” “Stretch,” “Vintage.”

Mention flaws (if major) – Use “FLAWED” early in the title if significant.

Avoid filler words – e.g., “Nice,” “Great,” “Look” – they waste space.

Do not include:

Symbols (!, *, etc.)

SKUs, product codes

Country unless Made in USA/Canada

Terms like “Denim” for jeans or "Mens" if already obvious from category (depends on your store system)

🔹 Category-Specific Tips
Jeans:
Include tag size + actual measured size if different. Include cut (bootcut, flare), rise (high rise), and style terms (Y2K, Grunge, Cowboy).
